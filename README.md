# MNIST_Maximum_Activation
Problem Statement and Solutions for the Deep Learning Task used to select project members for CVIG.

##Tasks
In this notebook we will be doing the following tasks:

1. Define a small convolutional neural network and train in on MNIST digit dataset (as a classification task).
2. Take the trained network, freeze all of its weights and learn the image which gives the output of a particular digit.(More popularly known as activation maximization) 
3. (Bonus) Try the same on a different dataset (like MNIST fashion dataset).
4. (Bonus) Try to formulate the MNIST classification problem as a regression problem instead. (i.e. Have 1 output unit which outputs a floating point value and you round it off to obtain the digit.)
